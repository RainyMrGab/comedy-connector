- [x] Task
  ```
  code
  ```

---

- [x] Created an nx workspace:
    ```
    pnpx create-nx-workspace --name=comedy-connector \
      --appName=frontend \
      --preset=angular-monorepo \
      --pm=pnpm \
      --bundler=esbuild \
      --style=scss \
      --ssr=false \
      --e2eTestRunner=playwright \
      --nxCloud=skip
    ```
- [x] Setup Amplify CLI - [see docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/angular/start/getting-started/installation/#configure-the-amplify-cli)
- [x] Add polyfill - [see docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/angular/start/project-setup/create-application/)
- [x] Create libs
  - nx generate @nx/angular:library appsync  --unitTestRunner=jest --style=scss --tags=shared --directory=libs/appsync
- [ ] Create Amplify backend - steps adapted from this [nx angular amplify tutorial](https://dev.to/beavearony/getting-started-with-a-angularnx-workspace-backed-by-an-aws-amplify-graphql-api---part-1-24m0)
  - Generate the angular library: `nx generate @nx/angular:library appsync`
  -
  - NOTE: the [amplify docs to create an app](https://docs.amplify.aws/angular/start/project-setup/create-application/) do not work with the nx setup
- [x] Setup Amplify UI components - [see docs](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/angular/getting-started/installation)
- Setup additional Angular features from [Amplify Dev Center](https://docs.amplify.aws/angular/)
  - [ ] Pre-built UI components
  - [ ] Auth
  - [ ] Serverless backend
  - [ ] Storage
  - [ ] GraphQL
- [ ] [Setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Getting Started

1. Prerequisites. Here's what you need to be able to run Comedy Connector locally:

   - Node.js
   - npm
   - npm global installs: `npx` `@angular/cli` `pnpm` `nx` 

2. Clone the repository

3. Build: `pnpm install'

4. Run the dev server: `pnpm run serve`  

5. Visit [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser. The application will automatically reload 
    if you change any of the source files.

## Development

### Start the app

To start the development server run `pnpm run serve`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

### Running unit tests

`nx test <app>` or to run all tests `pnpm run test`

### Running end-to-end tests

`nx e2e frontend` or to run all tests `pnpm run e2e`

### Running tasks

* To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax: `nx <target> <project> <...options>`
* You can also run multiple targets: `nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>`
* ..or add `-p` to filter specific projects: `nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>`
* Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks).

### Affected changes

* See what's been affected by changes: `nx affected:graph`
* run tests for current changes: `nx affected:test`
* run e2e tests for current changes: `nx affected:e2e`

### Editor Integration

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

### Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code).

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build comedy-connector` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.
